# AWS 

## What is cloud computing
- cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers,storage,databases,networking,software etc.
## benfits 
- faster time to market
- scalability and flexibility
- cost savings
- better collaboration
- advanced security
- data loss prevention
## disadvantage 
- risk of vendor lock-in
- less control over underlying cloud insfra
- concerns about security risks like data privacy and online threats
- integration complexity with exisiting systems
- unforseen costs and unexpected expenses

- example of private implementation softwares : openstack , opennebula 


## Hyperscalars : A hyperscaler is a type of large-scale data center that offers massive computing resources, typically in the form of an elastic cloud platform. Organizations use them to deploy and manage large-scale applications and services.

## Compute services 
- EC2  
- ECS/EKS : containerized services `
  - Fargate
- lambda : serverless 

## Storage Services
- S3
- EBS : Amazon Elastic Block Storage is a storage service wherein each block of storage acts like a separate hard drive (volume) . 
- EFS : dont need to assign any volume , can do on its own , seamless storage , database on EC2 instances 
- Archival service - Glacier : Amazon Glacier is extremely low cost, secure, and durable storage service for data archiving and
backup. That data stored which are not needed instantly , eg old data . Takes time min 4 hours or 1 day to retrieve request ( S3 instantly returns request)

## Network Services
- VPC : own insolated environment in a public cloud
- Domain Name Service - Route 53

- public subnet : can receive traffic from outerworld 
- private subnet : cannot receive traffic from outerworld but may or may not send traffic to outerworld

- **Apache web server works on layer 7 , using single apache server one can deploy multiple applications on different ports based on paths (URLbased) (virtual hosts) . virtual hosting can only work on layer 7**

## Application based LB 
- key pair : kind of like a password (public key is username; private key is password)
  - PPK (PuTTY Private Key) and PEM (Privacy Enhanced Mail) are two file formats that are commonly used for SSH and SSL/TLS connections. While PPK files are primarily used with PuTTY on Windows, PEM files are more widely supported and can be used with various tools and platforms

- security groups : A security group controls the traffic that is allowed to reach and leave the resources that it is associated with. For example, after you associate a security group with an EC2 instance, it controls the inbound and outbound traffic for the instance. When you create a VPC, it comes with a default security group. (acts as a firewall)

### Creating a target group 
- Your load balancer routes requests to the targets in a target group and performs health checks on the targets.
- LB routes traffic to target group then traffic group routes traffic to the back end ec2 instances or IP addresses etc

- going to the DNS name and reloading will take you to diff targets(3)
- this is **round robin** at work  

## AWS CLI : The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.
- BOTO library in python
